abstract = {A technique currently under development for the detection of macroscopic structural damage in elastic structures is described. The location and quantification of the extent of the damage in elastic structures is described. The location and quantification of the extent of the damage is performed with genetic algorithms implemented by using the residual force method which is based on conventional modal analysis theory. A brief survey of the literature published on the subject, the theory of genetic algorithms and the residual forces method are included and a new formulation of an objective function for the genetic search optimization procedure is presented. The results of test cases are included in order to illustrate the techniques presented. In these examples, experimental data were simulated numerically by using finite element models of structural systems and, as demonstrated, it has been possible to identify the damage introduced to a reasonable level of accuracy.},

abstract = {Structural damage detection has gained increasing attention from the scientific community since unpredicted major hazards, most with human losses, have been reported. Aircraft crashes and the catastrophic bridge failures are some examples. Security and economy aspects are the important motivations for increasing research on structural health monitoring. Since damage alters the dynamic characteristics of a structure, namely its eigenproperties (natural frequencies, modal damping and modes of vibration), several techniques based on experimental modal analysis have been developed in recent years. A method that covers the four steps of the process of damage detection*existence, localization, extent and prediction*has not yet been recognized or reported. The frequency-response- function (FRF) curvature method encompasses the "rst three referred steps being based on only the measured data without the need for any modal identi"cation. In this paper, the method is described theoretically and compared with two of the most referenced methods on literature. Numerically generated data, from a lumped-mass system, and experimental data, from a real bridge, are used for better illustration.},

Some comparative studies on single and multi-damage of a 2-story rigid frame structure have been carried out.

@misc{Wang2007,
abstract = {A combined analytical and experimental study is conducted to develop efficient and effective damage detection techniques for beam-type structures. Unlike many other vibration-based damage detection methods, in which the mode shapes are often chosen to retrieve damage information, the uniform load surface (ULS) is employed in this study due to its less sensitivity to ambient noise. In combination with the ULS, two new damage detection algorithms, i.e., the generalized fractal dimension (GFD) and simplified gapped-smoothing (SGS) methods, are proposed. The GFD method is developed by modifying the conventional definition of fractal dimension. By using a moving window, the GFD of ULS can be obtained for each sampling point, and due to the irregularity of ULS introduced by the damage, a peak exists on the GFD curve indicating the location of the damage. Not only does such a peak at the GFD curve locate the damage, but also it reveals the relative size of the damage. The SGS method is also proposed to take advantage of the simple deformation shape of ULS. Both methods are then applied to the ULS of cracked and delaminated beams obtained analytically, from which the damage location and size are determined successfully. Based on the experimentally measured curvature mode shapes, both the GFD and SGS methods are further applied to detect three different types of damage in carbon/epoxy composite beams. The successful detection of damage in the composite beams demonstrates that the new techniques developed in this study can be used efficiently and effectively in damage identification and health monitoring of beam-type structures.},

abstract = {This paper aims to compare several damage identification methods based on the analysis of modal curvature and related quantities (natural frequencies and modal strain energy) by evaluating their performances on the same test case, a damaged Euler–Bernoulli beam. Damage is modelled as a localized and uniform reduction of stiffness so that closed-form expressions of the mode-shape curvatures can be analytically computed and data accuracy, which affects final results, can be controlled. The selected techniques belong to two categories: one includes several methods that need reference data for detecting structural modifications due to damage, the second group, including the modified Laplacian operator and the fractal dimension, avoids the knowledge of the undamaged behavior for issuing a damage diagnosis. To explain better the different performances of the methods, the mathematical formulation has been revised in some cases so as to fit into a common framework where the underlying hypotheses are clearly stated. Because the various damage indexes are calculated on ‘exact’ data, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out with respect to the number of points where curvature information is available, to the position of damage between adjacent points, to the modes involved in the index computation. In this way, this analysis intends to point out comparatively the capability of locating and estimating damage of each method along with some critical issues already present with noiseless data.},

@article{Messina1998,
abstract = {During the last 20 years, the development of experimental modal analysis techniques has facilitated the accurate measurement of modal parameters in many types of structure. Alongside this work, several methods have been developed to detect structural damage by using location-dependent changes in the modal parameters. The paper extends the authors' work on a correlation coefficient termed the Multiple Damage Location Assurance Criterion (MDLAC) by introducing two methods of estimating the size of defects in a structure. Their effectiveness is illustrated using numerical data for two truss structures and both location and sizing algorithms are validated experimentally using a three-beam test structure. The paper also introduces a means of improving the computational efficiency of the damage location algorithm. The MDLAC approach offers the practical attraction of only requiring measurements of the changes in a few of the structure's natural frequencies between the undamaged states and is shown to provide good predictions of both the location and absolute size of damage at one or more sites.},

DP attempts to forecast system performance by assessing the current damage state of the system (i.e. SHM), estimating the future loading environments for that system, and predicting through simulation and past experience the remaining useful life of the system. The successful development of a DP capability will require the further development and integration of many technology areas including both measurement/processing/telemetry hardware and a variety of deterministic and probabilistic predictive modelling capabilities, as well as the ability to quantify the uncertainty in these predictions. The multidisciplinary and challenging nature of the DP problem, its current embryonic state of development, and its tremendous potential for life-safety and economic benefits qualify DP as a 'grand challenge' problem for engineers in the twenty-first century.},

The main idea behind our approach is the use of the negative of the q-gradient of the objective function as the search direction. In this sense, the method here proposed is a generalization of the well-known steepest descent method. The use of Jackson's derivative has shown to be an effective mechanism for escaping from local minima. The q-gradient method is complemented with strategies to generate the parameter q and to compute the step length in a way that the search process gradually shifts from global in the beginning to almost local search in the end. For testing this new approach, we considered six commonly used test functions and compared our results with three Genetic Algorithms (GAs) considered effective in optimizing multidimensional unimodal and multimodal functions. For the multimodal test functions, the q-gradient method outperformed the GAs, reaching the minimum with a better accuracy and with less function evaluations.},

abstract = {The process of implementing a damage identification strategy for aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering infrastructure is referred to as structural health monitoring (SHM). Here, damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of these systems, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools are available for such monitoring. However, the majority of SHM research conducted over the last 30 years has attempted to identify damage in structures on a more global basis. The past 10 years have seen a rapid increase in the amount of research related to SHM as quantified by the significant escalation in papers published on this subject. The increased interest in SHM and its associated potential for significant life-safety and economic benefits has motivated the need for this theme issue. This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognize that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and a paradigm to address such a problem is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for organization of this theme issue. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarizing the SPR paradigm, the subsequent articles in this theme issue are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM. In conclusion, technical challenges that must be addressed if SHM is to gain wider application are discussed in a general manner.},

@article{Deraemaeker2006,
abstract = {In this paper, a novel approach for vibration based damage detection is proposed. The approach relies on the use of a large network of sensors (possibly hundreds of them) to which a programmable linear combiner is attached. The linear combiner is programmed to work as a modal filter. The frequency content of the output of the modal filter is proposed as feature for damage detection. It is shown that if a local damage is present, spurious peaks appear in the FRF of the modal filter whereas if temperature changes are considered, the FRF of the modal filter is shifted but its shape remains unchanged. The approach is interesting because of the ability to differentiate between local damage and global environmental changes to a structure. Issues about the practical implementation of the method are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Fan2011,
abstract = {A comprehensive review on modal parameter-based damage identification methods for beam- or plate-type structures is presented, and the damage identification algorithms in terms of signal processing are particularly emphasized. Based on the vibration features, the damage identification methods are classified into four major categories: natural frequency-based methods, mode shape-based methods, curvature mode shape-based methods, and methods using both mode shapes and frequencies, and their merits and drawbacks are discussed. It is observed that most mode shape-based and curvature mode shape-based methods only focus on damage localization. In order to precisely locate the damage, the mode shape-based methods have to rely on optimization algorithms or signal processing techniques; while the curvature mode shape-based methods are in general a very effective type of damage localization algorithms. As an implementation, a comparative study of five extensively-used damage detection algorithms for beam-type structures is conducted to evaluate and demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the signal processing algorithms. This brief review aims to help the readers in identifying starting points for research in vibration-based damage identification and structural health monitoring and guides researchers and practitioners in better implementing available damage identification algorithms and signal processing methods for beam- or plate-type structures.},

There are three different kinds of beam structures to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. These three cases have different boundary conditions and different damage scenarios. From the results, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is efficient in flexural stiffness damage identification for beam-type structures under free of noise condition.

abstract = {A damage index (DI) approach for damage detection and localization based on high frequency wave propagation data and low frequency vibration measurements is presented. Improved ultrasonic and vibration test setups, consisting of either distributed high-fidelity piezoelectric sensor arrays or laser vibrometer, data acquisition boards, signal conditioning and dedicated software have been implemented. In the wave propagation measurements, the data consist of broadband signals due to ultrasonic waves propagating in the structure, while in the vibration measurements they are modal response of the structure produced by the actuators. Using the initial measurements performed on an undamaged structure as baseline, damage indices are evaluated from the comparison of the frequency response of the monitored structure with an unknown damage. In case of wave propagation measurements, a damaged/undamaged path mechanism is used to approximately locate the damage using the correlations obtained between the statistical DI (statistic t) values at the sensor locations (control points). For vibration measurements, both piezoelectric patches and the laser vibrometer are used as response sensors in an effort to examine their sensitivity to damage detection. It is found that the laser vibrometer acquisitions produce improved sensitivity and higher accuracy of the DI when compared to piezo-patches as response sensors. In addition, Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) has been used to compare and quantify the changes in the modal parameters evaluated from the measurements carried out on the healthy and damaged structure. The DI approach is used to identify various types of defects in the form of loose rivet holes, delaminations due to low velocity impact and added mass for changes in the stiffness, in both metallic and composite structural components with relatively complex geometries. It is shown that the procedure is able to identify an emerging and/or growing defect, with some degree of confidence. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classification learning is a powerful paradigm to investigate inverse input-output relationship of a specific problem according to some available and representative dataset. In particular, SVMs are able to identify even non-linear relationship by mapping non-linearly separable data into potentially linearly separable one through families of spatial transformation (kernel trick). With respect to this, several parameters (i.e., kernel function and its internal parameters) have to be tuned; however the optimal configuration is usually difficult to be defined a-priori. In this paper, a hyper-solution framework for SVM classification is presented. The main idea is to perform, simultaneously, three different SVM-based classification learning tasks: Model Selection, Multiple Kernel Learning and Ensemble Learning. The meta-heuristic known as Genetic Algorithms (GA) has been proposed to search for the most reliable final hyper-classifier (an SVM with a basic kernel, an SVM with a combination of kernel, or an ensemble of different SVMs, respectively), and the corresponding optimal configuration. We have applied the proposed framework on a critical and quite complex problem: the on-line assessment of structural health of aircraft fuselage panels, a crucial task both in military and civilian settings. In particular, the framework has been used to implement a diagnosis task, that is detecting a possible damage and identifying the structural component involved, according to the strain field measured through a monitoring sensor network deployed on the helicopter fuselage panels. Finite Elements (FE) simulation has been configured to simulate the response of a real panel to different damages. The resulting simulated strain fields have been used to build a dataset. Results obtained through 3 folds-cross validation proved the framework is reliable. Finally, when compared to results obtained by the authors in a previous work based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) classification learning paradigm, the proposed SVM framework proved to be more effective and reliable.},

abstract = {Structural damage detection remains as a challenging task in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM), which has occupied many scientific communities over the last two decades. As a new exploring attempt to the SHM problem, this paper proposes an ant colony optimization (ACO) based algorithm for continuous optimization problems on structural damage detection in the SHM field. First of all, the theoretical background of ACO is introduced for search of approximation best solution to discrete optimization problems and further to continuous optimization problems. Then four benchmark functions are used to evaluate the performance of continuous ACO (CnACO) algorithm. After that, the problem on the structural damage detection is mathematically converted into a constrained optimization problem, which is then hopefully solved by the CnACO algorithm. Meanwhile, effect of measurement noise on the algorithm is considered in all the damage scenarios. Upon extensive numerical simulations for single and multiple damages of a 2-storey rigid frame structure, the proposed method is extended to four damage patterns of a building model of 3-storey steel frame structure made in laboratory for further experimental verification of the proposed method. Illustrated results show that the proposed method is very effective for the structural damage detection. Regardless of weak damage or multiple damages, the identification accuracy is very high and the noise immunity is better, which shows that the proposed method is feasible and effective in the SHM field. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Impact damage is one of the major concerns in maintenance of aircraft structures built from composite materials. Damage detection in composite materials can be divided into active and passive approaches. The active approach is usually based on various non-destructive techniques utilizing actuators and/or receivers. In contrast passive approaches do not involve any actuators; receivers are used to “sense and/or hear” any perturbations caused by possible hidden damage. Often strain data are used to localize impacts and estimate their energy. The assumption is that damage occurs above well-defined energy of impacts. The paper illustrates one active and one passive method recently developed for impact damage detection. The first method, based on guided ultrasonic waves, utilises 3-D laser vibrometry and does not require any signal processing. Simple laser scans, revealing the change in Lamb wave response amplitudes, have been used to locate delamination and estimate its severity in a composite plate. In contrast, the second method does not require any sophisticated instrumentation but relies on advanced signal processing. An array of piezoceramic sensors has been to detect strain waves transmitted from an impact applied to the composite aircraft structure. The modified multilateration procedure with Genetic Algorithms has been used to locate impact position.},

abstract = {In this paper, an explicit time integration scheme is proposed for structural vibration analysis by using wavelet functions. Initially, the differential equation of vibration governing SDOF (single-degree of freedom) systems has been solved by wavelet operators, and later the proposed approach has been generalized for MDOF (multi-degrees of freedom) systems. For this purpose, two different types of wavelet functions have been exemplified including, complex Chebyshev wavelet functions and simple Haar wavelet functions. In the proposed approach, a straightforward formulation has been derived from the numerical approximation of response through the wavelet definition. Emphasizing on frequency-domain approximation, a simple step-by-step algorithm has been implemented and improved to calculate the response of MDOF systems. Moreover, stability and accuracy of results have been evaluated. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using three examples compared with some of the existing numerical integration schemes such as family of Newmark-??, Wilson-?? and central difference method. In all the procedures, computation time involved has also been considered. Finally, it is concluded that the vibration analysis of structures is improved by lesser computation time and high accuracy of proposed approach, particularly, in large-scaled systems. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The last decade witnessed the development of a large number of non-destructive tests for structural integrity evaluation. This growth is due to attracted interest to reduce time and costs to perform damage monitoring and predictive maintenance. In this way, several methods intended to detect structural damage based on sensitivity and statistical methods were proposed. However, some of these methods present some practical problems in measuring structural dynamic characteristics such as dynamic mode shapes. Some methods based exclusively on structural responses show disadvantages in finding the damage position on structures. There are two methods that are investigated in this work: the first is based on frequency sensitivity to the damage and the second one is based on optimization techniques and finite element parametric modelling. In this paper a genetic algorithm and a modal sensitivity method are used to identify and evaluate damage cases in a parametric numerical finite element model. A real coded genetic algorithm is used as an optimization tool. The results for the identification and evaluation of the damage in both methods were similar and they are compared. Some numerical examples are presented for structural damage detection on multiple sites and levels. It is emphasized the advantages of this methodology due to the little amount of information necessary as well as robustness.},

abstract = {Although a large number of methods exist for detecting damage in a structure using measured modal parameters, many of them require a correlated finite element model, or at least, modal data of the structure for the intact state as baseline. For one-dimensional beam-like structures, curvature techniques, e.g., mode shape curvature and flexibility curvature, have been applied to localize damage. In this paper a damage localization method based on changes in uniform load surface (ULS) curvature is developed for two-dimensional plate structures. A new approach to compute the ULS curvature is proposed based on the Chebyshev polynomial approximation, instead of the central difference method. The proposed method requires only the frequencies and mode shapes of the first few modes of the plate before and after damage, or only the eigenpairs for the damaged state if a gapped-smoothing technique is applied. Numerical simulations considering different supported conditions, measurement noise, mode truncation, and sensor sparsity are studied to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is found that the ULS curvature is sensitive to the presence of local damages, even with truncated, incomplete, and noisy measurements. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper describes a procedure for detecting structural damage based on a micro-genetic algorithm using incomplete and noisy modal test data. As the number of sensors used to measure modal data is normally small when compared with the degrees of freedom of the finite element model of the structure, the incomplete mode shape data are first expanded to match with all degrees of freedom of the finite element model under consideration. The elemental energy quotient difference is then employed to locate the damage domain approximately. Finally, a micro-genetic algorithm is used to quantify the damage extent by minimizing the errors between the measured data and numerical results. The process may be either of single-level or implemented through two-level search strategies. The study has covered the use of frequencies only and the combined use of both frequencies and mode shapes. The proposed method is applied to a single-span simply supported beam and a three-span continuous beam with multiple damage locations. In the study, the modal test data are simulated numerically using the finite element method. The measurement errors of modal data are simulated by superimposing random noise with appropriate magnitudes. The effectiveness of using frequencies and both frequencies and mode shapes as the data for quantification of damage extent are examined. The effects of incomplete and noisy modal test data on the accuracy of damage detection are also discussed.},

abstract = {The ultilisation of structural shape signals for damage localisation has shown some promise, especially in the applications where an accurate finite element model of the structure is not available. For this purpose, traditional shape signals, like mode shapes, flexibility matrices, uniform load surface (ULS) and operational deflection shapes (ODS) have been widely used. Using frequency response function (FRF) shapes for structural damage localisation is however, a relatively new but promising technique. Unlike mode shapes, ULS and ODS, FRF shapes are defined on broadband data and so have potential to reveal damage location more clearly. Another advantage of using FRF shapes is that the test data can be directly used without the necessity of conducting modal identification. Nevertheless, some problems associated with this approach still remain to be solved. No solid foundation or deduction about the use of FRF shapes for damage localisation has been given in any literature so far. In addition, it has been observed that this method only works for a low-frequency range. This limitation of FRF shapes has not been explained or well treated so far. In this study, a scheme of using FRF shapes for structural damage localisation is proposed. Methods within this scheme include some important modifications like using the imaginary parts of FRF shapes and normalising FRF shapes before comparison. The theoretical explanation of using FRF shapes for damage localisation is presented and the limitations of the previous FRF shape methods have been overcome. The proposed methods have shown great potential in structural damage localisation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this study, the problem is formulated as an optimization problem, which is then solved by using genetic algorithm (GA). Static measurements of displacements at few degrees of freedom (DOFs) are used to identify the changes of the characteristic properties of structural members such as Young's modulus and cross-sectional area, which are indicated by the difference of measured and computed responses. In order to avoid structural analyses in fitness evaluation, the displacements at unmeasured DOFs are also determined by GA. Unlike the traditional mathematical methods, which guide the direction of hill climbing by the derivatives of objective functions, GA searches the problem domain by the objective function itself at multiple points. The proposed method is able to detect the approximate location of the damage, even when practical considerations limit the number of on-site measurements to only a few.},

abstract = {Abstract Vibration-based damage detection (VBDD) comprises a promising set of techniques for damage detection and health monitoring of civil engineering structures. However, the successful application of these methods to real structures is still a challenging task, due primarily to the large size of such structures and the relatively high levels of variability in their dynamic response under operational load conditions. In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for the application of VBDD techniques, with the goal of enhancing their effectiveness for identifying and locating low damage levels and improving their applicability to the continuous or periodic health monitoring of structures. The basic features of the methodology include the use of a controlled and consistent excitation force, the use of operational deflection shapes (ODSs) at all measured frequency increments rather than only at natural frequencies, the use of a logarithmic scale for representing the ODS amplitudes at each frequency increment and the establishment of a threshold level for damage detection that accounts for experimental variability. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified and demonstrated by applying several Level 1 (damage detection) and Level 2 (damage localization) VBDD techniques using experimental data measured on a steel girder taken from a railway bridge. The proposed approach is shown to perform very well at detecting, locating and monitoring the growth of damage. Copyright 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd},

abstract = {When we talk about "smart structures" we can think about different properties and capabilities which make a structure "intelligent" in a certain sense. Originally, the expression "smart" was used in the context that a structure can react and adapt to certain environmental conditions, such as change of shape, compensation of deformations, active vibration damping, etc. Over the last year, the expression "smart" has been extended to the field of structural health monitoring (SHM), where sensor networks, actuators and computational capabilities are used to enable a structure to perform a self-diagnosis with the goal that this structure can release early warnings about a critical health state, locate and classify damage or even to forecast the remaining life-time. This paper intends to give an overview and point out recent developments of vibration-based methods for SHM. All these methods have in common that a structural change due to a damage results in a more or less significant change of the dynamic behavior. For the diagnosis an inverse problem has to be solved. We discuss the use of modal information as well as the direct use of forced and ambient vibrations in the time and frequency domain. Examples from civil and aerospace engineering as well as off-shore wind energy plants show the applicability of these methods. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Vibration-based damage detection, a nondestructive method, is based on the fact that vibration characteristics such as natural frequencies and mode shapes of structures are changed when the damage happens. This paper presents cooperative coevolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA), which is capable for an optimization problem with a large number of decision variables, as the optimizer for the vibration-based damage detection in beams. In the CCGA, a minimized objective function is a numerical indicator of differences between vibration characteristics of the actual damage and those of the anticipated damage. The damage detection in a uniform cross-section cantilever beam, a uniform strength cantilever beam, and a uniform cross-section simply supported beam is used as the test problems. Random noise in the vibration characteristics is also considered in the damage detection. In the simulation analysis, the CCGA provides the superior solutions to those that use standard genetic algorithms presented in previous works, although it uses less numbers of the generated solutions in solution search. The simulation results reveal that the CCGA can efficiently identify the occurred damage in beams for all test problems including the damage detection in a beam with a large number of divided elements such as 300 elements. © 2014 Kittipong Boonlong.},

abstract = {Up to now, existent FRF based model updating methods use the differences between measured and analytical FRFs at a fixed frequency, as residual to minimize. This approach does not take into account that FRFs between a reference model (experimental) and a perturbed one (a finite elements model not yet updated), displace in two axes : amplitude and frequency. A more physical correlation, then, uses also the frequency shift . The problem is how to find it. Taking as base the well known Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC), the Modal Scale Factor (MSF), and the concept of frequency shift, two correlation techniques, the Frequency Domain Assurance Criterion (FDAC) and the Frequency Response Scale Factor (FRSF), are presented. They help to quantify the level of correlation between responses coming from the two models, determine the frequency shift at all measured frequencies, and establish a suitable set of frequencies to use during the updating procedure},

Some properties of this Modal Strain Energy Change are given to illustrate its sensitivity in locating the structural damage. Information required in the identification are the measured mode shapes and elemental stiffness matrix only without knowledge of the complete stiffness and mass matrices of the structure. Several damage cases in a simulated structure are studied in which the effect of random error in terms of measurement noise in the mode shapes and systematic error in terms of errors from incomplete measurements are considered. This method is then applied to detect damage in a single-bay two-storey portal steel frame structure. Results illustrate that the MSEC is sensitive to damage, and the proposed method is simple and robust in locating single or multiple damages in a structure.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to seek efficient methods for multiple damage location in beam structures. Two methods are studied in terms of finite element model (FEM) simulations on beam structure. Firstly, a finite element model of reinforced concrete beam is established to compute changes in flexibility and flexibility curvature of the beam with various damage patterns, and sensitivities of flexibility and flexibility curvature for closely distributed damage patterns of various extents are also compared. Due to its high sensitivity to closely distributed damages, flexibility curvature is recommended for multiple damage location. Secondly, the full correlation between the relative frequency changes and the analytical frequency changes are confirmed with FEM analyses: therefore, the relative frequency changes, rather than the frequency changes themselves, are used in the multiple damage location assurance criterion (MDLAC) to increase the location efficiency. Numerous examples are presented to verify the two methods.},

A significant observation from this review is that although there are many more SHM studies being reported, the investigators, in general, have not yet fully embraced the well-developed tools from statistical pattern recognition. As such, the discrimination procedures employed are often lacking the appropriate rigor necessary for this technology to evolve beyond demonstration problems carried out in laboratory setting.},

abstract = {A damage in a structure alters its dynamic characteristics. The change is characterized by changes in the eigenparameters, i.e., natural frequency, damping values and the mode shapes associated with each natural frequency. Considerable effort has been spent in obtaining a relationship between the changes in eigenparameters, the damage location and the damage size. Most of the emphasis has been on using the changes in the natural frequencies and the damping values to determine the location and the size of the damage. In this paper a new parameter called curvature mode shape is investigated as a possible candidate for identifying and locating damage in a structure. By using a cantilever and a simply supported analytical beam model, it is shown here that the absolute changes in the curvature mode shapes are localized in the region of damage and hence can be used to detect damage in a structure. The changes in the curvature mode shapes increase with increasing size of damage. This information can be used to obtain the amount of damage in the structure. Finite element analysis was used to obtain the displacement mode shapes of the two models. By using a central difference approximation, curvature mode shapes were then calculated from the displacement mode shapes.},

To locate damage in the structure, the Damage Signature Matching (DSM) technique is improved through a proper definition of Measured Damage Signatures (MDS) and Predicted Damage Signatures (PDS). The effect of damage severity can be eliminated effectively as the result that the first-order approximation of changes in static deformation and natural frequencies are employed jointly in the damage signatures. The damage location, then, can be detected successfully by matching MDS with PDS. After obtaining the possible damage location, an iterative estimation scheme for solving non-linear optimization programming problems, which is based on the quadratic programming technique, is proposed to predict the damage extent. A remarkable characteristic of the present approach is that it can be directly applied in the cases of incomplete measured data. The correctness and the effectiveness of the algorithm are proved by two examples: A planar truss model with the numerically simulated data and a beam with two-fixed ends, of which the static response and the natural frequencies are obtained experimentally. The results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient for the damage identification.},

This paper presents part of an experimental and analytical survey of candidate methods for the in situ detection of damage in composite materials.

Changes in natural frequencies and modes were found using a laser vibrometer, and 2-D finite element models were created for comparison with the experimental results. The models accurately predicted the response of the specimens at low frequencies, but coalescence of higher frequency modes makes mode-dependant damage detection difficult for structural applications. The frequency response method was found to be reliable for detecting even small amounts of damage in a simple composite structure, however the potentially important information about damage type, size, location and orientation were lost using this method since several combinations of these variables can yield identical response signatures.},

With the help of a simple supported beam with different damage levels the reliability of these techniques will be investigated. The techniques reviewed herein are based on measured modal parameters which use only few mode shapes and/or modal frequencies of the structure that can be easily obtained by dynamic tests. In other words, by realizing two sets of dynamic measurements, corresponding to two moments of the structure lifetime, the dynamic modal parameters can be obtained. In order to assess properly the performance of these techniques different noise levels are randomly introduced to the response signals of a simulated beam which is exited by a random force. For different levels of damage and noise, the probabilities of damage detection and the probabilities of false alarm for the total number of simulations is evaluated. It can be concluded that among the evaluated techniques the strain energy method presents the best stability regarding noisy signals; however, the detection judgement depends on a threshold level which is discussed in this paper. The change in mode shape curvature, change in flexibility and change in flexibility curvature methods are also capable to detect and localise damaged elements but in the case of complex and simultaneous damages these techniques show less efficiency.},

Artificial damage (simulating termite degradation) was created in one of the walls of a specially constructed room. The wall was excited using an impact hammer and its frequency response measured using a laser vibrometer. Resonant poles (plotted in the s-plane) were used for identifying modes that are sensitive to damage, since not all modes are equally affected by the presence of damage. The damaged region was identified by visual comparison of the deformation mode shapes before and after damage. The modal residue and stiffness changes were also quantified for a better representation of the damage location.},

abstract = {Localized damage to a structure affects its dynamic properties, and much work has been undertaken investigating the variation of natural frequencies with damage. However, use of mode shape data has seen much less effort. This paper develops and presents a technique for identifying the location of structural damage in a beam. The procedure operates solely on the mode shape from the damaged structure, and does not requirea prioriknowledge of the undamaged structure. The procedure is developed using a one-dimensional finite element model of a beam, and demonstrated by experiment. When damage is severe (a localized thickness reduction of more than 10{\%}), applying a finite difference approximation of Laplace's differential operator to the mode shape successfully identifies the location of the damage. However, when damage is less severe, further processing of the Laplacian output is required before the location can be determined. This post-processing enables the location of thickness reductions of less than 0·5{\%} to be identified. The procedure is best suited to the mode shape obtained from the fundamental natural frequency. The mode shapes from higher natural frequencies can be used to verify the location of damage, but they are not as sensitive as the lower modes.},

abstract = {There are strong needs and requirements for on-line damage (delamination) detection and health-monitoring techniques on composite structures. Vibration-based model-dependent methods with piezoelectric sensor and actuator incorporated into composite structures offer a promising option to fulfil such requirements and needs. These methods utilize finite element analysis techniques, together with experimental results, to detect damage. They locate and estimate damage events by comparing dynamic responses between damaged and undamaged structures. According to the dynamic response parameters analyzed, these methods can be subdivided into modal analysis, frequency domain, time domain and impedance domain. Model-dependent methods are able to provide global and local damage information. They are cost-effective and are relatively easy to operate. However, there are still many challenges and obstacles before these methods can be implemented in practice.},

abstract = {The strategic and monetary value of the civil infrastructure worldwide necessitates the development of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems that can accurately   monitor structural response due to real-time loading conditions, detect damage in the structure, and report the location and nature of this damage. In the last  decade, extensive research has been carried out for developing vibration-based damage detection algorithms that can relate structural dynamics changes to damage  occurrence in a structure. In the mean time, the wavelet transform (WT), a signal processing technique based on a windowing approach of dilated    scaled' and shifted wavelets, is being applied to a broad range of engineering applications. Wavelet transform has proven its ability to overcome   many of the limitations of the widely used Fourier transform (FT); hence, it has gained popularity as an efficient means of signal processing in SHM systems. This  increasing interest in WT for SHM in diverse applications motivates the authors to write an exposition on the current WT technologies.  This article presents a utilitarian view of WT and its technologies. By reviewing the state-of-the-art in WT for SHM, the article discusses specific needs of SHM   addressed by WT, classifies WT for damage detection into various fields, and describes features unique to WT that lends itself to SHM. The ultimate intent of   this article is to provide the readers with a background on the various aspects of WT that might appeal to their need and sector of interest in SHM. Additionally, the  comprehensive literature review that comprises this study will provide the interested reader a focused search to investigate using wavelets in SHM.},

To test the algorithm in more realistic environment of practical data acquisition, measuring noise with various levels has been added to the analyzed signal.

A series of numerical simulations on a simple beam are made in order to compare various damage detection methods based on mode shape changes.

The objective of such a study is to ascertain the possibility of using various damage detection methods without the need for modal identification. In recent years, the authors have developed some simple methods and tools based upon the use of frequency response functions (FRFs), which seem promising and have given good results in some practical applications. Here, some of that work is applied to the new proposed FRF-based methods which are compared and discussed.

The information acquired in real-time would also benefit the understanding on fracture mechanics of composites, improving the confidence in their use and broadening their applications. The cost of inspection is approximately one-third of acquiring and operating composite structures. In order to compete in the increasingly demanding area of aircraft structures cost effective techniques need to be developed. Large areas need to be scanned rapidly without removal of individual components, minimising the disruption of the structure’s operation.

abstract = {One of the key issues in composite structures for aircraft applications is the early identification of damage. Often, service induced damage does not involve visible plastic deformation, but internal matrix related damage. A wide range of technologies, comprising global vibration and local wave propagation methods, can be employed for health monitoring purposes. Traditional modal analysis based methods are linear methods. The effectiveness of these methods is sometimes limited since they rely on a stationary and linear description of the system. The nonlinear interaction between a low frequency wave field and a local impact induced damage in a composite skin–stiffener structure is experimentally demonstrated in this work. The different mechanisms linked to the distorted waveforms are separated with the help of phase portraits. The harmonic waveform distortions are concentrated at the damaged region and increased for higher excitation amplitudes. It is shown that linear damage identification methods are feasible for low excitation amplitudes, but that the presence of nonlinear dynamic effects cannot remain silent for higher amplitudes. Analyzing the damage induced nonlinear effects can provide useful information about the current state of the structure.},

The fundamental vibration mode of a cracked cantilever beam is analysed and both the location and size of the crack are estimated. The location of the crack is determined by the sudden changes in the spatial variation of the analysed response, while the size of the crack is related to the fractal dimension measure. The proposed prediction scheme was validated by experiments on cracked plexiglas beams. A noise test performed on simulated data proved the ability of the method to accurately identify cracks despite the presence of noise in the signal analysed. Based on the results obtained, a fractal dimension-based crack detector (FDCD) is developed, which can be effectively used in practical applications. Compared to existing methods for crack detection, the proposed FDCD scheme is attractive due to the simplicity of the evaluation of the fractal dimension measure and its robustness against noise. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The process of implementing a damage detection strategy for aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering infrastructure is referred to as structural health monitoring (SHM). In many cases damage causes a structure that initially behaves in a predominantly linear manner to exhibit nonlinear response when subject to its operating environment. The formation of cracks that subsequently open and close under operating loads is an example of such damage. The damage detection process can be significantly enhanced if one takes advantage of these nonlinear effects when extracting damage-sensitive features from measured data. This paper will provide a review of examples from nonlinear dynamical systems theory and from nonlinear system identification techniques that are used for the feature-extraction portion of the damage detection process. This paper is not intended as a comprehensive review of all damage detection methods rooted in nonlinear dynamics, but rather to provide a number of illustrations of complimentary approaches where damage-sensitive data features are based on nonlinear system response. These features, in turn, can either be used as a direct diagnosis of damage or as input to statistical damage classifier. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

A sensitivity matrix consisting of the first differential of the autoregressive coefficients of the time series models with respect to the stiffness of the structural elements is then obtained based on time domain response data. The locations and severities of the damage may be finally estimated by solving for the damage vector whose components are the damage degrees of the structural elements. The efficiency and capability of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying the method to a FEM model of a simplified offshore platform structure with damages at single or two elements. Numerical simulations show that the use of a few sensors' acceleration history data with certain level measurement noises is capable of detecting damages efficiently and the increase in numbers of sensors helps for improving the diagnosis success rate.},

The basic strategy is to train a neural network to recognize the behavior of the undamaged structure as well as the behavior of the structure with various possible damage states. When the trained network is subjected to the measurements of the structural response, it should be able to detect any existing damage.

The SHM systems proposed recently are incorporated with Vibration-Based Damage Detection (VBDD) techniques, Statistical Methods and Signal processing techniques and have been regarded as efficient and economical ways to solve the problem. The recent development in damage detection and condition assessment techniques based on VBDD and statistical methods are reviewed. The VBDD methods based on changes in natural frequencies, curvature/strain modes, modal strain energy (MSE) dynamic flexibility, artificial neural networks (ANN) before and after damage and other signal processing methods like Wavelet techniques and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) Hilbert spectrum methods are discussed here.},

abstract = {Nonlinear acoustic technique has been recently introduced as a new tool for nondestructive inspection and evaluation of fatigued, defective, and fractured materials. Various defects such as cracks, debonding, fatigue, etc. lead to anomalous high levels of nonlinearity as compared with flawless structures. One of the acoustic manifestations of such nonlinearity is the modulation of ultrasound by low frequency vibration. Two methods employing the nonlinear interaction of ultrasound and vibration were developed, namely vibromodulation (VM) and impactmodulation (IM) methods. VM method employs forced harmonic vibration of a structure tested, while IM method uses impact excitation of structure natural modes of vibration. The feasibility tests were carried out for different objects and demonstrated high sensitivity of the methods for detection of cracks in steel pipes and pins, bonding quality in titanium and thermoplastic plates used for airspace applications, cracks in combustion engine, adhesion flaws in bonded composite structures, and cracks and corrosion in reinforced concrete. The model of the crack allowing to describe the modulation of sound by vibration is discussed. The developed nonlinear technique demonstrated certain advantages as compared with the conventional linear acoustic technique, specifically discrimination capabilities, sensitivity, and applicability to highly inhomogeneous structures.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel optimization algorithm which is a hybrid of particle swarm optimization (PSO) method and genetic algorithm (GA). Using the Ackley and Schwefel multimodal benchmark functions incorporating up to 25 variables, the performance of the hybrid is compared with pure PSO and GA and found to be far superior in convergence and accuracy. The hybrid algorithm is then used to identify multiple crack damages in a thin plate using an inverse time-domain formulation. The damage is detected using an orthotropic finite element (FE) model based on the strain energy equivalence principle. The identification is carried out using time-domain acceleration responses. The principle is to minimize the difference between the measured and theoretically predicted accelerations. Since the computational effort of identifying the use of global FE model proved prohibitive, a quarter substructure was identified which contains 72 damage variables.

abstract = {Damage detection in civil engineering constructions using the dynamic system parameters has become an important research topic. A direct, fast and inexpensive method is therefore required to evaluate and localize damage using the change in dynamic parameters between the intact and damage states. This paper investigates the application of the change in modal curvatures to detect damage in a prestressed concrete bridge. To establish the method simply supported and continuous beams containing damaged parts at different locations are tested using simulated data. Some important conclusions concerning the computation of the modal curvatures are drawn. A damage indicator called “curvature damage factor” is introduced, in which the difference in curvature mode shape for all modes can be summarized in one number for each measured point. The technique is further applied to a real structure, namely bridge Z24 which lies between the villages Koppigen and Utzenstorf and crosses the highway A1 between Bern and Zurich in Switzerland. In the framework of a Brite-Euram project, the bridge is used as a full-scale specimen and subjected to different damage scenarios in order to introduce damage.},

@article{Adhikari2000,
abstract = {This dissertation reports a systematic study on analysis and identification of multiple parameter damped mechanical systems. The attention is focused on viscously and non-viscously damped multiple degree-of- freedom linear vibrating systems. The non-viscous damping model is such that the damping forces depend on the past history of motion via convolution integrals over some kernel functions. The familiar viscous damping model is a special case of this general linear damping model when the kernel functions have no memory. The concept of proportional damping is critically examined and a generalized form of proportional damping is proposed. It is shown that the proportional damping can exist even when the damping mechanism is non-viscous. Classical modal analysis is extended to deal with general non-viscously damped multiple degree-of- freedom linear dynamic systems. The newmethod is similar to the existing method with some modifications due to non-viscous effect of the damping mechanism. The concept of (complex) elastic modes and non- viscous modes have been introduced and numerical methods are suggested to obtain them. It is further shown that the system response can be obtained exactly in terms of these modes. Mode orthogonality relationships, known for undamped or viscously damped systems, have been generalized to non-viscously damped systems. Several useful results which relate the modes with the system matrices are developed. These theoretical developments on non-viscously damped systems, in line with classical modal analysis, give impetus towards understanding damping mechanisms in general mechanical systems. Based on a first-order perturbation method, an approach is suggested to the identify non-proportional viscous damping matrix from the measured complex modes and frequencies. This approach is then further extended to identify non-viscous damping models. Both the approaches are simple, direct, and can be used with incomplete modal data. It is observed that these methods yield non-physical results by breaking the symmetry of the fitted damping matrix when the damping mechanism of the original system is significantly different from what is fitted. To solve this problem, approaches are suggested to preserve the symmetry of the identified viscous and non-viscous damping matrix. The damping identification methods are applied experimentally to a beam in bending vibration with localized constrained layer damping. Since the identification method requires complex modal data, a general method for identification of complex modes and complex frequencies from a set of measured transfer functions have been developed. It is shown that the proposed methods can give useful information about the true damping mechanism of the beam considered for the experiment. Further, it is demonstrated that the damping identification methods are likely to perform quite well even for the case when noisy data is obtained. The work conducted here clarifies some fundamental issues regarding damping in linear dynamic sys- tems and develops efficient methods for analysis and identification of generally damped linear systems.},

Since the sensitivities are calculated on the basis of the experimentally determined mode shapes, there is no need for a prior finite element model of the test structure. The applicability of this technique is discussed on the basis of damage detection experiments performed on a beam-like structure (laboratory conditions) as well as data from the experiments on the I-40 highway bridge in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

abstract = {Two frequency response correlation criteria, namely the global shape correlation (GSC) function and the global amplitude correlation (GAC) function, are established tools to quantify the correlation between predictions from a finite-element (FE) model and measured data for the purposes of FE model validation and updating. This paper extends the application of these two correlation criteria to structural health monitoring and damage detection. In addition, window-averaged versions of the GSC and GAC, namely WAIGSC and WAIGAC, are defined as effective damage indicators to quantify the change in structural response. An integrated method of structural health monitoring and damage assessment, based on the correlation functions and radial basis function neural networks, is proposed and the technique is applied to a bookshelf structure with 24 measured responses. The undamaged and damaged states, single and multiple damage locations. as well as damage levels, were successfully identified in all cases studied. The ability of the proposed method to cope with incomplete measurements is also discussed. CITED BY GREG KAWCHUK IN HIS VIBRATION FOR DIAGNOSIS PAPERS},

Structural health monitoring has the potential to make structures safer by observing both long-term structural changes and immediate postdisaster damage. However, the many SHM studies in the literature apply different monitoring methods to different structures, making side-by-side comparison of the methods difficult. This paper details the first phase in a benchmark SHM problem organized under the auspices of the IASC–ASCE Structural Health Monitoring Task Group. The scale-model structure adopted for use in this benchmark problem is described. Then, two analytical models based on the structure—one a 12 degree of freedom (DOF) shear-building model, the other a 120-DOF model, both finite element based—are given.

This paper describes an approach to this problem using vibration data. It involves a three-stage process: reduction of the time-series data using principle component analysis (PCA), the development of a data-based model using an auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) model using data from an undamaged structure, and the classification of whether or not the structure is damaged using a fuzzy clustering approach. The approach is applied to data from a benchmark structure from Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA. Two fuzzy clustering algorithms are compared: fuzzy c-means (FCM) and Gustafson–Kessel (GK) algorithms. It is shown that while both fuzzy clustering algorithms are effective, the GK algorithm marginally outperforms the FCM algorithm.},

abstract = {A damage in a structure alters its dynamic characteristics. The change is characterized by changes in the modal parameters, i.e., modal frequencies, modal damping values and mode shapes associated with each modal frequency. Changes also occur in some of the structural parameters; namely, the mass, damping, stiffness and flexibility matrices of the structure. In this paper, evaluation of changes in the flexibility matrix of a structure is presented as a candidate method not only for identifying the presence of the damage but also locating the damage. It is shown that the flexibility matrix can be easily and accurately estimated from a few of the lower frequency modes of vibration of the structure, which can be easily measured. First, with simple analytical beam models, the effect of presence of damage in a structure on its flexibility is studied. By using these analytical models, the effectiveness of using changes in the flexibility matrix in detecting and locating damages is demonstrated. The procedure is then tested with experimental data collected on a wide-flange steel beam.},

abstract = {For damage detection, a hybrid technique consisting of two strategies is proposed. First, grey relation analysis is used to exclude the impossible damage locations such that the number of design variables can be reduced. By using two simple rules proposed in this work, all actual damage locations are included as possible damage locations and the number of design variables is effectively reduced. Secondly, a real-parameter genetic algorithm is combined with simulated annealing and adaptive mechanisms for finding the actual damages. The proposed hybrid algorithm uses only vertical nodal displacements of static responses. In addition to the ideal error-free case in which there is no difference between the experimental data and the theoretical data, the case with 5{\%} error, in which the experimental data is simulated by adding 5{\%} error maximum to the corresponding theoretical data, is considered for measuring error and modeling error. From the results, it is demonstrated that the proposed technique is efficient in damage identification. For the error-free case, the predicted results agree with the true solutions exactly. For the case with 5{\%} error, the prediction obtained is also reasonable. ?? 2007.},

abstract = {Most of vibration-based damage detection methods require the modal properties that are obtained from measured signals through the system identification techniques. However, the modal properties such as natural frequencies and mode shapes are not such a good sensitive indication of structural damage. The wavelet packet transform (WPT) is a mathematical tool that has a special advantage over the traditional Fourier transform in analyzing non-stationary signals. It adopts redundant basis functions and hence can provide an arbitrary time-frequency resolution. In this study, a damage detection index called wavelet packet energy rate index (WPERI), is proposed for the damage detection of beam structures. The measured dynamic signals are decomposed into the wavelet packet components and the wavelet energy rate index is computed to indicate the structural damage. The proposed damage identification method is firstly illustrated with a simulated simply supported beam and the identified damage is satisfactory with assumed damage. Afterward, the method is applied to the tested steel beams with three damage scenarios in the laboratory. Despite the noise is present for real measurement data, the identified damage pattern is comparable with the tests. Both simulated and experimental studies demonstrated that the WPT-based energy rate index is a good candidate index that is sensitive to structural local damage.},

abstract = {The use of the electro-mechanical (E/M) impedance method for health monitoring of thin plates and aerospace structures is described. As a nondestructive evaluation technology, the E/M impedance method allows us to identify the local dynamics of the structure directly through the E/M impedance signatures of piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) permanently mounted to the structure. An analytical model for 2-D thin-wall structures, which predicts the E/M impedance response at PWAS terminals, was developed and validated. The model accounts for axial and flexural vibrations of the structure and considers both the structural dynamics and the sensor dynamics. Calibration experiments performed on circular thin plates with centrally attached PWAS showed that the presence of damage modifies the high-frequency E/M impedance spectrum causing frequency shifts, peak splitting, and appearance of new harmonics. Overall-statistics damage metrics and probabilistic neural network (PNN) are used to classify the spectral data and identify damage severity. On thin-wall aircraft panels, the presence of damage influences the sensors E/M impedance spectrum.When crack damage is in the PWAS medium field, changes in the distribution of harmonics take place and when crack damage is in the PWAS near field, changes in both the harmonics and the dereverberated response are observed. These effects are successfully classified with PNN and overall-statistics metrics, respectively. This proves that permanently attached PWAS in conjunction with the E/M impedance method can be successfully used in structural health monitoring to detect the presence of incipient damage through the examination and classification of the high-frequency E/M impedance spectra.},

The next step, performed in the presented part of the research, is to assess the severity of the damage. It is shown that combining results from a frequency based analysis and from a modal strain energy based analysis can enhance the quantification of the severity estimation.

Measurements are performed on an intact and an artificially delaminated structure, using a laser-vibro measuring system to determine the response to a force excitation. A commercially available Finite Element package is employed for the numerical model. The aim of the numerical model is to perform a parametric study. The study is preceded by an experimental verification of the numerical model. Subsequently, it is used to analyse the effect of the size and location of a delamination, as well as the number of data points employed, on the damage index.},

Earlier investigations on composite structures with stiffeners revealed that a vibration based structural health monitoring approach employing the Modal Strain Energy Damage Index algorithm can detect and localise delaminations. The next step performed in the part of the research presented is to assess the severity of the damage. It is shown that parametric studies enhance the reliability of the damage severity assessment based on measured data, since a wide range of damage cases can be studied in advance, possibly under variable environmental conditions. The benefit of numerical models is also found in the ability to select measuring points in a smart way, hence optimising the efficiency of the data acquisition system. The amount of damage related information is maximised for a minimal number of sensor positions.},

The research comprises a theoretical part and an experimental part. An impact load is applied to the skin-stiffener structure, resulting in a delamination underneath the stiffener. The structure is interrogated with a low frequency pump excitation and a high frequency carrier excitation. The analysis of the response in a frequency band around the carrier frequency is employed to assess the damage identification capabilities and to gain a better understanding of the modulations occurring and the underlying physical phenomena. Though vibro-acoustic is shown to be a sensitive method for damage identification, the complexity of the damage, combined with a high modal density, complicate the understanding of the relation between the physical phenomena and the modulations occurring.},

@phdthesis{Ooijevaar2014b,
abstract = {Composite materials combine a high strength and stiffness with a relatively low density. These materials can, however, exhibit complex types of damage, like transverse cracks and delaminations. These damage scenarios can severely influence the structural performance of a component. Periodic inspections are required to ensure the integrity of a component during its life. The current inspection methods are often time-consuming, costly and require the components to be readily accessible. Vibration based structural health monitoring (SHM) technologies propose a promising alternative and involve the continuous monitoring of a structure by employing an integrated sensor system. These methods are based on the concept that the dynamic behavior of a structure can change if damage occurs. Although many damage identification methods have been proposed in the literature, there are still numerous difficulties in the practical application of these approaches, especially to complex structures. The performance of a vibration based damage identification approach is highly dependent on the actual design of the structure and the damage scenario that is considered. This thesis focuses on the identification of damage in advanced composite skin-stiffener structures. The principle objective is to develop guidelines for the detection, localization and characterization of damage in composite skin-stiffener structures based on changes in the dynamic behavior. A literature study supported by an analytical model showed that mode shape curvatures combined with the modal strain energy damage index (MSE-DI) algorithm are a potentially powerful damage feature and classifier for the identification of damage in several advanced composite skin-stiffener structures. A experimental set-up, including a shaker and laser-vibrometer, was used to measure the dynamic responses. A linear dynamic system description is obtained by applying experimental modal analysis. The vibration experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the MSE-DI algorithm to detect, localize and roughly estimate the size of barely visible impact damage (BVID) in advanced composite skin-stiffener structures. It is concluded that the method is particularly effective for health monitoring of skin-stiffener connections. The method remained inconclusive in the case of pure skin related damage. Experiments showed that damage at the skin-stiffener interface can introduce clear nonlinear effects in the dynamic behavior of the structure. These nonlinear effects are attributed to the interaction between the skin and stiffener that occurs during opening and closing motion of the damage. It is shown that linear damage identification methods (e.g. modal domain methods) are feasible for low excitation amplitudes, but the presence of nonlinear dynamic effects cannot remain silent for higher amplitudes. The nonlinear dynamic effects can act as strong indicator of damage, but can also be useful for characterization purposes. The nonlinear dynamic effects introduced by the skin-stiffener damage urges the development of nonlinear damage identification methods. A study on the understanding and feasibility of using nonlinear vibro-acoustic modulations for the detection, localization and characterization of impact damage in a composite T- beam is presented. A time domain analysis at multiple spatial locations is used to detect and localize impact damage in a skin-stiffener connection, based on locally increased amplitude modulation effects. Analysis of the characteristics of the nonlinear modulations opens the ability to characterize the nonlinear dynamic behavior introduced by the damage at the skin-stiffener interface. The work presented in this thesis showed that the relations between the characteristics of the structure, the potential damage scenarios and the damage identification method together define the performance of the vibration based damage identification strategy. Therefore, it is concluded that the design of a vibration based damage identification strategy is made-to-measure work and requires a thorough physical understanding of the potential failure mechanisms, the critical damage locations and their effect on the dynamic behavior. To aid in this process, a scenario based procedure for the design of a damage identification strategy is proposed. All findings presented in this thesis contribute to the development of a design tool for research engineers, to assist the implementation of structural health monitoring technology in safety-critical composite structures.},

abstract = {In this paper, an enhanced version of the opposition-based differential evolution (ODE) is proposed. ODE utilizes opposite numbers in the population initialization and generation jumping to accelerate differential evolution (DE). Instead of opposite numbers, in this work, quasi opposite points are used. So, we call the new extension quasi- oppositional DE (QODE). The proposed mathematical proof shows that in a black-box optimization problem quasi- opposite points have a higher chance to be closer to the solution than opposite points. A test suite with 15 benchmark functions has been employed to compare performance of DE, ODE, and QODE experimentally. Results confirm that QODE performs better than ODE and DE in overall. Details for the proposed approach and the conducted experiments are provided.},

However, these population-based algorithms are computationally expensive due to the slow nature of the evolutionary process. This paper presents a novel algorithm to accelerate the differential evolution (DE). The proposed opposition-based DE (ODE) employs opposition-based learning (OBL) for population initialization and also for generation jumping. In this work, opposite numbers have been utilized to improve the convergence rate of DE. A comprehensive set of 58 complex benchmark functions including a wide range of dimensions is employed for experimental verification. The influence of dimensionality, population size, jumping rate, and various mutation strategies are also investigated. Additionally, the contribution of opposite numbers is empirically verified. We also provide a comparison of ODE to fuzzy adaptive DE (FADE). Experimental results confirm that the ODE outperforms the original DE and FADE in terms of convergence speed and solution accuracy.},

@article{Gu2011,
abstract = {Cored beads (also known as pellicular, superficially porous, and fused-cored beads or particles) offer advantages over fully porous beads in reduced diffusional mass transfer resistances in particle macropores and separation times in liquid chromatography (LC). They are also used to regulate bead densities. The core of a bead has a relatively small volume and yet presents a large linear distance for diffusional mass transfer inside particle macropores. Using a non-porous inert core, intraparticle diffusional mass transfer resistance can be reduced with a relatively small loss in binding capacities. In multicompnent isocratic elution chromatography, cored beads are a compromise between fully porous beads and non-porous beads. Non-porous beads completely eliminate intraparticle diffusion, providing sharp elution peaks with the shortest retention times. However, they do not provide a sufficient retention time range for peaks to separate in preparative LC because of their limited binding capacities. At the other end, fully porous beads offer the largest retention time differences, but suffering from excessive band broadening. For a particular multicomponent elution system, core radius fraction can be optimized to take the advantages of both fully porous beads and non-porous beads. This work presented a general rate model for cored beads and its numerical solution strategy. The model considered axial dispersion, interfacial mass transfer, intraparticle diffusion, and multicomponent Langmuir isotherm. Computer simulation was used to study the effects of core radius fraction on breakthrough curves and elution peaks. The model was used to optimize the core radius fraction for a preparative ternary elution system as an example case. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Guiochon2002,
abstract = {The status of the theory and the main methods of implementation of preparative liquid chromatography are reviewed. On the theory front, the focus has recently shifted. The theory of non-linear, non-ideal chromatography has given rise to numerous models whose advantages, disadvantages and ranges of application are now well understood. Interest now resides in investigating the equilibrium thermodynamics of complex new systems, in the study of the kinetics of mass transfers in conventional chromatographic systems, and in the application of the various models of chromatography to optimize the experimental conditions. Progress in computer technology allows the use of sophisticated models, provided their parameters can be measured. This allows the detailed investigation of separations for which the mass transfer kinetics is slow such as chiral separations, the purification of basic compounds, and the extraction of recombinant proteins. On the applied front, in addition to numerous incremental improvements in reliability and economic performance, a few essential new features should be noted, i.e. the availability of instruments for simulated moving bed separations at the scale needed for preparative chiral separations, the use of expanded beds for the extraction of recombinant proteins from fermentation broths, and the attention given to improvements in the performance of packed beds. A survey of the literature dealing with practical applications and recent meetings shows that preparative chromatography is becoming a well established separation and purification method in the pharmaceutical industry.},

journal="Journal of Civil Structural Health Monitoring",
year="2016",
volume="6",
number="3",
pages="545--560",
abstract="Detecting structural damage in civil engineering structures has become an increasingly viable option for efficient maintenance and management of infrastructures. Vibration-based damage detection methods have been widely used for structural health monitoring. However, those methods may not be effective when modal properties have significant variance under environmental effects, especially severe temperature changes. In this paper, an extended Kalman filter-based artificial neural network (EKFNN) method is developed to eliminate the temperature effects and detect damage for structures equipped with long-term monitoring systems. Based on the vibration acceleration and temperature data obtained from an in-service highway bridge located in Connecticut, United States, the correlations between natural frequencies and temperature are analyzed to select proper input variables for the neural network model. Weights of the neural network are estimated by extended Kalman filter, which is also used to derive the confidence intervals of the natural frequencies to detect the damage. A year-long monitoring data are fed into the developed neural network for the training purpose. To assess the changes of natural frequencies in real structural damages, structural damage scenarios are simulated in the finite element model. Numerical testing results show that the temperature-induced changes in natural frequencies have been considered prior to the establishment of the threshold in the damage warning system, and the simulated damages have been successfully captured. The advantages of EKFNN method are presented through comparing with benchmark multiple linear regressions method, showing the potential of this method for structural health monitoring of highway bridge structures.",

The method can handle very efficiently, (a) design for multiple loading conditions, (b) stress constraints, (c) constraints on displacements, (d) constraints on sizes of the elements. Examples of bar and beam structures are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. Some of these examples are compared with the designs obtained by linear and nonlinear programming methods. The method is extremely efficient in obtaining minimum weight structures and in a small fraction of the computer time required by linear and nonlinear programming methods."
